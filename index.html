						My name is Amir Ashtiany, I'm currently a personal trainer who is
						looking for a career change due to Covid. I recently enrolled into
						GW Coding Bootcamp and really getting excited in learning more and
						completing more projects.
					</p>
					<p>
						I was born in Iran and moved to America when I was only three years
						old. I went to highschool locally, I never finished school because
						to be honest I had no idea what I wanted to be in the future. I
						later signed up to get my personal trainer certification where I
						ended up training for 5 years, one of those years being at 24 Hour
						Fitness and the rest being an independent contractor and later
						started my own business called "Ashtiany Fitness".
					</p>

					<p>
						Everything was going well and I was extremly busy until Covid hit. I
						soon realized how expendible my career was and how I needed
						something more sustainable especially because I just got enganged
						that same year. So I looked online and I always wanted to get into
						coding but neber knew where to start nor did I have time. Luckily I
						ran into GW Bootcamp for coding and heard nothing but good things
						about it. So I put that invested to start a new chapter in my life.
